I understand the issue now - the query field is missing entirely in the URL generated by the data link. Let's fix this by examining the URL structure more carefully.

When a Grafana data link opens a Tempo explore view, the TraceQL query should be properly included in the generated URL. The problem might be that the JSON encoding within the URL isn't being processed correctly.

Here's a revised version that ensures the query field is preserved in the generated URL:

```json
{
  "targetBlank": true,
  "title": "Traces for Status Code/Endpoint",
  "url": "/explore?orgId=1&left=%7B%22datasource%22:%22tempo%22,%22queries%22:%5B%7B%22refId%22:%22A%22,%22datasource%22:%7B%22type%22:%22tempo%22,%22uid%22:%22tempo%22%7D,%22queryType%22:%22traceql%22,%22limit%22:20,%22query%22:%22%7B%20.http.target%20%3D%20%5C%22${__data.fields.http_target}%5C%22%20%26%26%20.http.status_code%20%3D%20${__data.fields.http_status_code}%20%7D%22%7D%5D,%22range%22:%7B%22from%22:%22now-1h%22,%22to%22:%22now%22%7D%7D"
}
```

This approach uses URL encoding for the entire `left` parameter value, which is more reliable for complex nested JSON structures.

If you still encounter issues, try this alternative approach which is even more reliable. It uses the native variable format for passing values to the URL:

```json
{
  "targetBlank": true,
  "title": "Traces for Status Code/Endpoint",
  "url": "/explore?orgId=1&left=%7B%22datasource%22:%22tempo%22,%22queries%22:%5B%7B%22refId%22:%22A%22,%22datasource%22:%7B%22type%22:%22tempo%22,%22uid%22:%22tempo%22%7D,%22queryType%22:%22traceql%22,%22limit%22:20,%22query%22:%22%7B%20.http.target%20%3D%20%5C%22${__data.fields.http_target:raw}%5C%22%20%26%26%20.http.status_code%20%3D%20${__data.fields.http_status_code:raw}%20%7D%22%7D%5D,%22range%22:%7B%22from%22:%22now-1h%22,%22to%22:%22now%22%7D%7D"
}
```

The `:raw` suffix on the variable references helps prevent additional escaping that might interfere with the query structure.

Alternatively, if you're still having issues, you might try the most basic approach - using Grafana's built-in URL parameter encoding:

```json
{
  "targetBlank": true,
  "title": "Traces for Status Code/Endpoint",
  "url": "/explore?orgId=1&datasource=tempo&queryType=traceql&query={.http.target = \"${__data.fields.http_target:raw}\" && .http.status_code = ${__data.fields.http_status_code:raw}}&from=now-1h&to=now"
}
```

This last approach bypasses the complex JSON structure entirely and uses simpler URL parameters, which might be more reliable in some Grafana versions.
