Conversation with Gemini
you are a seasoned site reliability engineer with expertise in grafana lgtm stack implementation and application monitoring:

Draft a full-scale detailed plan of setting up a grafana lgtm stack on aks for observability of multiple teir 1 grade applications. Plan should include a detailed and comprehensive size capacity planning stratergy, testing and monitoring stratergy of lgtm stack ( for its components and infra) .

It should have a detailed stratergy on how to use alloy agent by grafana to collect logs, metrics and traces from different application and send to centralized lgtm stack. For sake of an example should there be 2 agents, one at application end and one at lgtm end in this scenario alloy agent at app end will add necessary labels and drop unneeded metrics,logs and traces, the alloy agent at lgtm end will check for the necessary labels etc(plese be aware that this is just an example, you are free to provide stratergy which you beleive is best suited, not just this 2 agent one whose example i have just given).

Startergy should include templatization of config.alloy to swiftly onboard different application.Â 

Stratergy should also include filtering of scenarios like high cardinality metrics, debug logs, unnneccessary traces etc at source alloy agent.

Detailed planning documentation on onboarding applications for monitoring using alloy agent which sends metrics,logsa dn traces to lgtm setup.

in the end draft me epics and associated issues for each epic to get this done as part of project

Full-Scale Detailed Plan: Grafana LGTM Stack on AKS for Tier 1 Application Observability
This document outlines a comprehensive plan for establishing a robust and scalable Grafana LGTM (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) stack on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This setup will provide centralized observability for multiple Tier 1 grade applications, leveraging Grafana Alloy for efficient data collection.

Project Goal: To implement a production-ready, highly available, and performant Grafana LGTM stack on AKS, enabling comprehensive monitoring (logs, metrics, traces) for critical Tier 1 applications, with streamlined application onboarding and proactive stack monitoring.

Date: May 13, 2025

1. Core Tenets & Strategy
Centralized Observability: A single pane of glass (Grafana) for logs (Loki), metrics (Mimir), and traces (Tempo).
Scalability & Resilience: Design for horizontal scalability and high availability of all LGTM components on AKS.
Cost Efficiency: Optimize storage, compute, and data transfer costs through strategic data filtering, retention policies, and resource allocation.
Automation: Automate deployment, configuration, and upgrades of the LGTM stack and Alloy agents.
Security: Implement robust authentication, authorization, and network policies for the LGTM stack and data in transit/rest.
Actionable Insights: Focus on collecting data that translates into actionable insights for application performance, reliability, and troubleshooting.
Developer Self-Service: Enable application teams to easily onboard their applications and access their observability data.
2. Grafana LGTM Stack Architecture on AKS
This architecture will consist of the following core components deployed on an AKS cluster:

Grafana: For visualization, dashboarding, and alerting.
Loki: For log aggregation and querying.
Components: Distributor, Ingester, Querier, Query Frontend, (Optional: Compactor, Ruler).
Mimir: For long-term storage and querying of Prometheus-compatible metrics.
Components: Distributor, Ingester, Querier, Query Frontend, Store-Gateway, Compactor, Ruler, Alertmanager.
Tempo: For distributed tracing.
Components: Distributor, Ingester, Querier, Query Frontend, Compactor, (Optional: Metrics Generator).
Grafana Alloy (formerly Grafana Agent): Deployed as a DaemonSet on application AKS clusters and potentially as a central aggregator/processor within the LGTM AKS cluster.
Supporting Infrastructure:
Azure Blob Storage: For long-term storage for Loki (chunks, index), Mimir (blocks), and Tempo (blocks).
Azure Cache for Redis (Optional but Recommended): For caching in Loki, Mimir, and Tempo to improve performance.
Azure Load Balancers/Ingress Controllers (e.g., Nginx, Traefik, Application Gateway Ingress Controller): For exposing Grafana, Loki, Mimir, and Tempo endpoints.
Prometheus Operator (Optional but Recommended): For managing Prometheus instances for Mimir scraping or for scraping LGTM components themselves.
Cert-Manager: For automated TLS certificate management.

3. Size and Capacity Planning Strategy
This is a critical phase and requires an iterative approach.

3.1. Data Ingestion Estimation (per Tier 1 Application):

Logs:
Volume: Average log lines per second/minute/hour, peak volume.
Size: Average size per log line.
Cardinality: Number of unique label combinations (e.g., app, namespace, level, instance).
Retention: How long logs need to be stored (e.g., 7 days hot, 30 days cold).
Metrics:
Number of Series: Total active time series.
Scrape Interval: Frequency of metric collection.
Cardinality: Number of unique label combinations for metrics. High cardinality is a primary concern for Mimir.
Retention: How long metrics need to be stored (e.g., 30 days hot, 1 year cold).
Traces:
Number of Spans: Average and peak spans per second/minute.
Sampling Rate: Percentage of traces being collected.
Size per Span: Average data size of a span.
Retention: How long traces need to be stored (e.g., 14 days).
3.2. LGTM Component Sizing:

General Approach:

Start with recommended defaults from Grafana Labs documentation for each component.
Scale based on the aggregated data ingestion estimates from all Tier 1 applications.
Utilize Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics (e.g., queue lengths for Loki/Mimir distributors).
Use appropriate instance types for AKS nodes (e.g., memory-optimized for Ingesters, CPU-optimized for Queriers).
Loki:

Ingesters: Memory is key. Sized based on active streams and configured chunk size. Consider max_global_streams_per_user.
Distributors: CPU and network. Scale based on incoming log rate.
Queriers & Query Frontend: CPU and memory. Scale based on query load and complexity.
Storage (Azure Blob): Estimate based on daily log volume * retention period * compression ratio.
Mimir:

Ingesters: Memory is critical, especially with high cardinality. Sized based on active series, samples per second, and configured max_global_series_per_user.
Distributors: CPU and network. Scale based on incoming sample rate.
Queriers & Query Frontend: CPU and memory. Scale based on query load, range, and complexity.
Store-Gateways: CPU, memory, and network I/O. Scale based on query load on historical data.
Compactors: CPU and I/O intensive.
Storage (Azure Blob): Estimate based on samples per day * retention period * bytes per sample * compression.
Tempo:

Ingesters: Memory and CPU. Scale based on span ingestion rate.
Distributors: CPU and network.
Queriers & Query Frontend: CPU and memory. Scale based on trace lookup volume.
Compactors: CPU and I/O.
Storage (Azure Blob): Estimate based on daily trace volume * retention period * compression.
Grafana:

CPU and memory. Scale based on concurrent users, number of dashboards, and query complexity.
Alloy Agents (Edge):

Resource footprint is generally low but depends on the number of pipelines, targets, and complexity of processing. Monitor closely.
3.3. AKS Cluster Sizing:

Node Pools: Create dedicated node pools for:
LGTM stateful components (Ingesters, Compactors, Store-Gateways) â potentially with high memory/IOPS optimized VMs.
LGTM stateless components (Distributors, Queriers, Grafana) â general-purpose VMs.
(Optional) Central Alloy Agent processing nodes.
Overall Cluster Capacity: Sum of resources required by all LGTM components + Kubernetes overhead + buffer for scaling and updates.
Network Configuration: Ensure sufficient network bandwidth and low latency between application clusters and the LGTM cluster, and between LGTM components and Azure Storage/Redis.
3.4. Iterative Refinement:

Start Small, Grow: Begin with a conservative estimate and scale up as more applications are onboarded and actual load is observed.
Performance Testing: Crucial for validating capacity assumptions before going live with all Tier 1 apps. Simulate peak loads.
Continuous Monitoring: Monitor resource utilization, queue lengths, error rates, and query latencies of the LGTM stack itself to identify bottlenecks and adjust capacity.
4. Testing and Monitoring Strategy for the LGTM Stack
4.1. Testing Strategy:

Unit Tests (for custom configurations/scripts): Validate Alloy configurations, Grafana dashboard provisioning scripts, etc.
Integration Tests:
Verify data flow from a sample application -> Alloy Agent -> LGTM components -> Grafana.
Test querying capabilities for logs, metrics, and traces.
Validate alert firing and notification.
Performance Tests:
Load Testing: Simulate high ingestion rates for logs, metrics, and traces using tools like loggen, prombench, Grafana k6 with tracing extensions.
Stress Testing: Push the system beyond expected peak loads to identify breaking points.
Soak Testing: Run sustained loads for extended periods to check for memory leaks or performance degradation over time.
Query Performance Testing: Test complex and frequent queries against Loki, Mimir, and Tempo.
Resilience/Chaos Testing:
Simulate node failures in AKS.
Test component restarts and recovery (e.g., kill Ingester pods).
Verify data persistence and recovery from Azure Storage.
Test failover of HPA-managed components.
Upgrade Testing: Test the upgrade process for each LGTM component in a staging environment.
4.2. Monitoring Strategy (Monitoring the Monitors):

Golden Signals for each LGTM Component:
Latency: Query latency, ingestion latency.
Traffic: Ingestion rate (logs/sec, samples/sec, spans/sec), query rate.
Errors: Ingestion errors, query errors, internal component errors.
Saturation: CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk I/O, network I/O, queue lengths, cache hit/miss rates.
Key Metrics to Monitor:
Loki:
loki_distributor_lines_received_total, loki_ingester_streams_opened_total, loki_ingester_memory_streams_bytes
loki_panic_total, loki_request_duration_seconds_bucket (for various operations)
Ingester queue lengths, distributor queue lengths.
Mimir:
cortex_distributor_samples_in_total, cortex_ingester_active_series, cortex_ingester_memory_series
cortex_panic_total, cortex_request_duration_seconds_bucket
mimir_ingester_tsdb_head_max_samples_per_query
Ingester queue lengths, distributor queue lengths, store-gateway cache hit rates.
Tempo:
tempo_distributor_spans_received_total, tempo_ingester_traces_stored_total
tempo_panic_total, tempo_request_duration_seconds_bucket
Ingester queue lengths.
Grafana:
grafana_page_load_time_seconds, grafana_api_request_duration_seconds_bucket
grafana_datasources_query_duration_seconds
Active users, dashboard load times.
Alloy Agents (Edge & Central):
alloy_component_flow_processed_bytes_total, alloy_component_flow_processed_entries_total
alloy_exporter_send_failures_total
CPU and memory usage of Alloy pods.
AKS Cluster:
Node CPU/Memory/Disk/Network utilization.
Pod restart counts, health checks.
API server latency.
Azure Storage:
Latency, throughput, error rates for Blob Storage.
Azure Cache for Redis:
CPU, memory, cache hit/miss ratio, network throughput.
Dashboards: Create dedicated Grafana dashboards for monitoring the health and performance of the LGTM stack.
Alerting: Set up alerts for:
Component unavailability or high error rates.
High resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk).
High ingestion/query latency.
Critical queue build-ups.
Storage capacity issues.
Failed data exports from Alloy agents.
5. Grafana Alloy Agent Strategy
5.1. Architecture:

Edge Alloy Agents:
Deployed as a DaemonSet on each application AKS cluster (and potentially on VMs for non-containerized apps).
Responsibilities:
Discovery: Auto-discover application pods, services, and log files based on Kubernetes labels and annotations.
Collection: Scrape Prometheus metrics, collect logs from container stdout/stderr and files, receive traces via OTLP.
Initial Processing & Filtering (at source):
Labeling: Add essential metadata (e.g., cluster_name, namespace, app_name, pod_name, container_name, tier="tier1"). These labels are crucial for querying and multi-tenancy in Loki/Mimir.
Metric Relabeling/Filtering: Drop unnecessary metrics or labels to reduce cardinality (e.g., pod_ip, instance-specific high-cardinality labels if not needed centrally). Use relabel_configs and metric_relabel_configs.
Log Filtering: Drop debug logs in production environments unless explicitly enabled. Filter out sensitive information (PII scrubbing if possible, though complex).
Trace Sampling: Implement head-based or tail-based sampling strategies if full trace collection is too expensive or noisy. (Tail-based sampling might be better handled by a central Alloy or dedicated sampling processor if Tempo doesn't have robust support directly).
Exporting: Securely forward processed data to the centralized LGTM stack components (Loki, Mimir, Tempo).
Central Alloy Agent (Optional but Recommended for Advanced Scenarios):
Deployed within the LGTM AKS cluster.
Responsibilities:
Aggregation (if needed): Collect data from multiple edge Alloy agents if direct routing is not preferred or if further centralized processing is required.
Advanced Processing & Enrichment:
Perform more complex relabeling or metric generation that is common across many sources.
Enrich data with information from external systems (e.g., CMDB).
Centralized PII scrubbing or data masking (if edge scrubbing is insufficient).
Conditional Routing: Route data to different backends or apply different processing pipelines based on labels or content (e.g., route audit logs to a separate security system).
Label Validation (as per user example): While edge agents should add necessary labels, a central agent could act as a gatekeeper to ensure data conforms to expected schemas or has mandatory labels before ingestion into Mimir/Loki. However, this adds a hop and potential bottleneck. It's often better to enforce this at the edge and monitor for non-compliance.
Metric Generation from Logs (e.g., log-based metrics for Loki): Alloy can parse logs and generate metrics.
Decision on Central Agent:
Start without it if: Edge agents can handle all necessary processing and filtering, and direct export to LGTM components is feasible and manageable.
Consider it if: Complex cross-application processing, centralized enrichment, advanced routing, or a strict "gatekeeping" function for data quality is required. For Tier 1 apps, ensuring data quality upfront is crucial, so a central agent for validation/enrichment could be valuable but needs careful performance consideration.
5.2. Templatization of config.alloy:

Goal: Create reusable Alloy configuration snippets/modules to onboard applications quickly and consistently.
Strategy:
Base Configuration Template: A core config.alloy that includes:
Exporter configurations for Loki, Mimir, Tempo pointing to the central LGTM stack endpoints (using Kubernetes service discovery or configurable URLs).
Default scrape job configurations (e.g., scraping Kubernetes pods, services).
Default log collection configurations (e.g., collecting stdout/stderr from all containers in a namespace).
Basic health and metrics endpoints for the Alloy agent itself.
Application-Specific Overlays/Modules:
Use Alloy's import functionality or a configuration management tool (like Helm, Kustomize, Jsonnet) to layer application-specific configurations on top of the base template.
Parameters for Customization:
Application name, namespace.
Specific metrics endpoints, scrape intervals.
Log file paths (if not stdout/stderr).
Custom labels to be added.
Filtering rules for logs/metrics/traces (e.g., drop specific log levels, metric names, span attributes).
Enable/disable specific collectors (logs, metrics, traces) per application.
Example Structure (Conceptual using Alloy Flow):
Code snippet

// base_config.alloy (simplified)
logging {
  level  = "info"
  format = "logfmt"
}

// Exporters (configured via variables/secrets)
otelcol.exporter.loki "central_loki" {
  client {
    url = env("LOKI_URL")
    // ... other settings (auth, tls)
  }
}
// ... similar for Mimir (prometheus.remote_write) and Tempo (otelcol.exporter.otlp)

// ---- To be imported by app-specific configs ----
// modules/kubernetes_logs.alloy
// argument "namespace" {}
// argument "app_label_selector" {}
// loki.source.kubernetes "app_logs" {
//   namespaces = [argument.namespace.value]
//   // ... selectors, relabeling using app_label_selector
//   forward_to = [otelcol.exporter.loki.central_loki.input]
// }

// modules/kubernetes_metrics.alloy
// argument "namespace" {}
// argument "app_label_selector" {}
// discovery.kubernetes "app_pods" {
//   selectors = [
//     { role = "pod", label = argument.app_label_selector.value },
//   ]
//   namespaces = [argument.namespace.value]
// }
// prometheus.scrape "app_metrics" {
//   targets    = discovery.kubernetes.app_pods.targets
//   forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.central_mimir.receiver]
//   // ... relabeling
// }
Code snippet

// app_X_config.alloy
import.module "k8s_logs" {
  path = "modules/kubernetes_logs.alloy"
  arguments = {
    namespace = "app-x-ns"
    app_label_selector = "app=my-app-x"
  }
}
import.module "k8s_metrics" {
  path = "modules/kubernetes_metrics.alloy"
  arguments = {
    namespace = "app-x-ns"
    app_label_selector = "app=my-app-x"
  }
  // Add specific metric filtering for app-x
  // prometheus.scrape.app_metrics.job_name should have metric_relabel_configs
}
// Tracing pipeline for app-x
otelcol.receiver.otlp "app_x_traces" {
  grpc {}
  http {}
}
otelcol.processor.batch "app_x_batch" {
  output {
    metrics = [] // or forward to a metrics pipeline if needed
    logs    = []
    traces  = [otelcol.exporter.otlp.central_tempo.input]
  }
}
otelcol.exporter.otlp "central_tempo" {
  // ... configuration ...
}
Configuration Management:
Store base templates and application-specific configurations in a Git repository.
Use Helm charts with values files for deploying Alloy agents with their specific configurations.
Alternatively, use Kustomize overlays.
Consider tools like Grafana Agent Operator (if mature enough for Alloy) or custom operators for managing Alloy configurations CRDs.
5.3. Filtering Strategies at Source (Edge Alloy Agent):

High Cardinality Metrics:
Identify: Use Mimir's cardinality analysis tools or Grafana dashboards (e.g., sum(count by (__name__) ({__name__=~".+"}))) to find problematic metrics.
Actions in Alloy prometheus.scrape or otelcol.processor.attributes / otelcol.processor.filter:
metric_relabel_configs:
action: drop: Remove metrics matching a pattern.
action: labeldrop: Remove specific labels (e.g., instance_ip, pod_hash if not strictly needed).
action: replace: Aggregate label values (e.g., replace specific error codes with a generic 'error' category).
otelcol.processor.attributes (for OTLP metrics): Modify or remove attributes.
otelcol.processor.filter (for OTLP metrics): Drop metrics based on attributes.
Example (Prometheus relabeling):
Code snippet

prometheus.scrape "app_metrics" {
  // ...
  metric_relabel_configs = [
    // Drop metrics with high cardinality 'user_id' label
    { source_labels = ["__name__", "user_id"], regex = "some_metric_name;.+", action = "drop" },
    // Drop the 'instance_ip' label from all metrics
    { action = "labeldrop", regex = "instance_ip" },
  ]
}
Debug Logs:
Application Responsibility: Applications should ideally control their log levels via configuration.
Alloy Filtering (as a safety net or for inflexible apps) using loki.process stage or otelcol.processor.filter:
Loki processing stage (loki.process):
Code snippet

loki.source.kubernetes "all_logs" { /* ... */ }
loki.process "filter_debug" {
  forward_to = [otelcol.exporter.loki.central_loki.input]
  stage.match {
    selector = "{level=\"debug\"}" // Assuming 'level' label exists
    action   = "drop"
    // For production, you might want to drop unless a specific 'debug_enabled' label is present
  }
}
// Or using regex on the log line itself if 'level' is not a label
// stage.match {
//   selector = "{namespace=\"prod\"}"
//   stage.regex { expression = "^.*DEBUG.*$" } // Example, refine regex
//   action = "drop"
// }
OTLP Logs (otelcol.processor.filter):
Code snippet

otelcol.processor.filter "log_filter" {
  error_mode = "send" // send to next if filter fails, or 'remove'
  logs {
    log_record = [
      // Drop if attribute 'log.severity' is DEBUG (numeric value might vary)
      'attributes["log.severity"] == "DEBUG"', // Or use numeric severity
    ]
    action = "exclude" // or "include"
  }
  output {
    logs = [/* next component */]
  }
}
Unnecessary Traces:
Application Instrumentation: Best controlled at the instrumentation level (e.g., OpenTelemetry SDK sampling configurations).
Edge Alloy Agent Sampling (otelcol.processor.probabilistic_sampler or otelcol.processor.spanmetrics + filtering based on metrics):
otelcol.processor.probabilistic_sampler: Head-based sampling.
Code snippet

otelcol.processor.probabilistic_sampler "trace_sampler" {
  sampling_percentage = 10.0 // Sample 10% of traces
  hash_seed           = 22
  output {
    traces = [/* next component e.g. batch processor */]
  }
}
otelcol.processor.spanmetrics can generate metrics from spans (e.g., count of spans per operation). These metrics could then be used to dynamically adjust sampling or to identify noisy operations that need more aggressive sampling or filtering.
otelcol.processor.filter (for OTLP traces): Filter traces based on span attributes (e.g., drop health check traces).
Code snippet

otelcol.processor.filter "trace_filter_healthchecks" {
  traces {
    span = [
      // Drop if span name contains '/health'
      'name matches ".*\/health.*"'
    ]
    action = "exclude"
  }
  output {
    traces = [/* next component */]
  }
}
Tempo Configuration: Tempo itself can have some sampling capabilities or be integrated with external sampling processors, but filtering at the source reduces load on Tempo.
6. Onboarding Applications for Monitoring
This section outlines the documentation and process for application teams.

6.1. Prerequisites for Application Teams:

Application deployed on AKS.
Understanding of application's key performance indicators (KPIs), critical log messages, and important trace points.
(If not using auto-discovery) Knowledge of Prometheus metrics endpoint(s), log file locations (if not stdout/stderr).
For tracing: Application instrumented with OpenTelemetry (or Jaeger/Zipkin compatible libraries) and configured to export traces to the Alloy Agent's OTLP receiver endpoint (e.g., alloy-agent-otelcol.alloy-namespace.svc.cluster.local:4317).
6.2. Onboarding Process:

Request Observability:
Application team submits a request (e.g., via a Jira ticket, service catalog item).
Provide application details: name, namespace, criticality, expected data volumes (rough estimate), key contacts.
Consultation & Configuration Planning (SRE Team + App Team):
Discuss specific monitoring requirements:
Custom metrics to be scraped.
Specific log formats, parsing requirements (if any beyond standard JSON/logfmt).
Critical transaction paths for tracing.
Alerting requirements (what to alert on, thresholds, notification channels).
Identify potential high cardinality metrics, noisy logs, or verbose traces to filter.
Alloy Agent Configuration:
SRE team (or app team with SRE guidance) prepares the Alloy Agent configuration:
Select the appropriate base template.
Create/update application-specific overlay/module (e.g., Helm values file).
Define discovery rules (if needed).
Specify relabel_configs, metric_relabel_configs, log processing stages, trace sampling/filtering rules.
Add necessary labels for consistent tagging (e.g., team, product_area).
Deployment of Alloy Configuration:
Deploy/update the Alloy Agent configuration to the application's AKS cluster (e.g., via Helm upgrade, GitOps pipeline).
If a DaemonSet is used, ensure it's scheduled on nodes where the application runs.
Verification:
Data Flow:
Check Alloy Agent logs for successful collection and export.
Verify logs appear in Grafana/Loki.
Verify metrics appear in Grafana/Mimir (use Metrics Explorer).
Verify traces appear in Grafana/Tempo.
Labeling: Ensure all required labels are present and correct.
Filtering: Confirm that unwanted data is being dropped.
Dashboarding & Alerting Setup:
Application team (with SRE support) creates application-specific dashboards in Grafana.
SRE team (or app team) configures alerts in Grafana/Mimir Alertmanager based on agreed-upon conditions.
Documentation & Training:
Provide application team with links to their dashboards, relevant query examples.
Brief training on using Grafana for their application's data.
Document the specific Alloy configuration applied for their application.
Iterate & Refine:
Continuously monitor application observability data and Alloy Agent performance.
Adjust configurations as needed based on application changes or new monitoring requirements.
6.3. Self-Service (Future Goal):

Develop a library of well-documented Alloy configuration modules.
Provide clear guidelines and examples for common use cases.
Potentially create a UI or CLI tool for generating basic Alloy configurations.
GitOps flow where app teams can propose Alloy configuration changes via Pull Requests (with SRE review).
7. Security Considerations
Network Policies:
Restrict traffic to LGTM components (Loki, Mimir, Tempo, Grafana) only from authorized sources (Alloy Agents, user access points).
Ensure Alloy Agents can only reach the necessary LGTM endpoints.
Authentication & Authorization:
Grafana: Integrate with an identity provider (e.g., Azure AD) for user authentication. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within Grafana.
Loki/Mimir/Tempo:
Enable multi-tenancy using X-Scope-OrgID header. Alloy Agent can be configured to send this.
Protect public-facing API endpoints with authentication (e.g., OAuth2 Proxy, API Gateway authentication).
Consider mTLS between components if traversing untrusted networks (though within an AKS cluster, network policies might suffice).
Data Encryption:
In Transit: Use TLS for all communication (Alloy to LGTM, inter-component, user to Grafana). Use Cert-Manager for automated certificate management.
At Rest: Azure Blob Storage provides server-side encryption by default. Evaluate if client-side encryption is needed for extreme security requirements.
Secrets Management:
Store sensitive configurations (API keys, passwords, connection strings for storage/cache) in Azure Key Vault and mount them securely into pods (e.g., using Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver).
Least Privilege:
Alloy Agents should have the minimum necessary permissions on the AKS cluster (e.g., to read pod/service metadata, access logs).
LGTM components should run with restricted service accounts.
Regular Security Audits & Updates: Keep all LGTM components, AKS, and underlying dependencies patched and updated.
